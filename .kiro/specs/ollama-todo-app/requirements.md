# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a local to-do list application that leverages AI capabilities through Ollama for intelligent task management. The application will have a React 19 frontend built with Vite and TypeScript, and a Python backend that connects to a local Ollama model using the ollama-python library. Created todo objects will be stored in a local PostgreSQL database for persistence and reliable data management. The system will allow users to manage their tasks while providing AI-powered features like task suggestions, categorization, and smart reminders. I need to store created todo objects in local PostgreSQL database. There a should be chat that will connect frontend to send prompt local Ollama models. Ollama should return to-do list with dates based on initial prompt. As an option user should also have an opportunity to add to-do lists to his google calendar.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete tasks in my to-do list, so that I can manage my daily activities effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new task THEN the system SHALL store the task in PostgreSQL with a title, description, due date, and priority level
2. WHEN a user views their task list THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display all tasks from PostgreSQL with their current status and details
3. WHEN a user updates a task THEN the system SHALL save the changes to PostgreSQL and reflect them immediately in the interface
4. WHEN a user deletes a task THEN the system SHALL remove it from PostgreSQL and update the display
5. WHEN a user marks a task as complete THEN the system SHALL update the task status and visually indicate completion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered task suggestions and categorization, so that I can better organize and prioritize my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a task THEN the system SHALL use Ollama to suggest appropriate categories and priority levels
2. WHEN a user has multiple tasks THEN the system SHALL provide AI-generated suggestions for task ordering and scheduling
3. WHEN a user requests task analysis THEN the system SHALL use Ollama to provide insights about workload and time management
4. IF a task description is vague THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements or clarifications using AI

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive web interface built with modern React, so that I can access my to-do list efficiently across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean, intuitive React 19 interface
2. WHEN a user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates without page refreshes
3. WHEN a user accesses the app on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively
4. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and loading states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to run locally with my own Ollama model, so that my data remains private and I have full control over the AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL connect to a local Ollama instance using the ollama-python library
2. WHEN the Ollama service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade AI features while maintaining core functionality
3. WHEN AI features are requested THEN the system SHALL process requests through the local Ollama model without external API calls
4. WHEN the system processes tasks THEN all data SHALL remain on the local machine without external transmission

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a chat interface that connects to Ollama, so that I can generate structured to-do lists from natural language prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a prompt in the chat interface THEN the system SHALL send the prompt to the local Ollama model
2. WHEN Ollama processes the prompt THEN the system SHALL return a structured to-do list with tasks and suggested dates
3. WHEN the AI generates tasks THEN the system SHALL allow users to review and modify the generated tasks before adding them to their list
4. WHEN the chat generates multiple tasks THEN the system SHALL provide options to add all tasks at once or select individual tasks
5. WHEN a user submits a complex prompt THEN the system SHALL parse it into actionable tasks with appropriate priorities and deadlines

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to sync my to-do items with Google Calendar, so that I can manage my tasks alongside my existing calendar events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables Google Calendar integration THEN the system SHALL authenticate with Google Calendar API
2. WHEN a user creates a task with a due date THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add it to Google Calendar
3. WHEN a user adds a task to Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL create a calendar event with the task details
4. WHEN a user updates a task that's synced to Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding calendar event
5. IF Google Calendar is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally with local task management only

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application built with TypeScript and modern tooling, so that the codebase is maintainable and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
3. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent code quality through linting and formatting
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide clear error handling and logging for debugging
